This project builds a Fuzzy Bayesian Network (FBN) to model cyber attack flows with uncertainty. It converts STIX-formatted threat intelligence into a Bayesian Network while using fuzzy logic to represent imprecise evidence. Users can provide linguistic inputs (low, moderate, high) instead of binary evidence.
